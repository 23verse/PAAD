The high rate of mortality indicates that prognosis becomes worse over time, lacking effective systematic therapies available for patients. We recognize that the high mortality of PAAD in China can be traced back to the lack of comprehensive molecular subtyping (and prognostic models to evaluate risk levels of relapse). The current histopathological classifications are of limited use to guide clinical decision-making, and there is an unmet need to identify new biomarkers for molecular subtyping in PAAD. "]]
