We recognize that the high mortality of PAAD in China can be traced back to the lack of comprehensive molecular subtyping (and prognostic models to evaluate risk levels of relapse). We also realize that the current histopathological classifications for PAAD are of limited use to guide clinical decision-making. Therefore, there is an unmet need to identify new biomarkers for molecular subtyping in PAAD. 1.2 What has known in literature The current stratification for PAAD patients is mainly based on: the mutation profiles of genes, including homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (see paper), and highly mutated genes (such as KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A and SMAD4; see paper); and the RNA-seq expression data to estimate immune cytolytic activity (see paper). 1.3 What has done this study We report the mutational landscape of 608 PAAD patients, the largest cohort ever in China, generating the most comprehensive resource on genetic alternations (covering somatic mutations, pathogenic germline variants, copy number variations, and well-known genomic markers, such as tumor mutational burden, copy number instability and somatic signatures). Based on the information of point mutations in either HRR genes or highly mutated genes, as mentioned above (What has known in literature), we find no associations with prognosis. We are the first to report that the poor prognosis is associated with amplification of genes involved in DNA repair and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) related signaling pathways, establishing the clinical link between CNV and prognosis in PAAD. Using the copy number variations (CNV) information of genes involved in DNA repair and RTK related signaling pathways, we are able to stratify patients into four molecular subtypes (namely, repair-deficient, proliferation-active, repair-proficient and repair-enhanced subtypes) that differ in prognosis. We show that repair-deficient and proliferation-active subtypes are better suited for DNA damage therapies, while immunotherapy highly recommended for repair-proficient and repair-enhanced subtypes. We construct a prognostic model incorporating the information on CNV of DNA repair and RTK related genes, and illustrate the use of the constructed model in distinguishing patients with high and low risk of relapse. We reinforce the prognostic value of our identified genes in DNA repair and RTK related signaling pathways by analyzing publicly available datasets. "],["mutational-landscape.html", "Section 2 Mutational landscape", " Section 2 Mutational landscape We carried out a cohort study involving 608 PAAD patients in China and, for each patient, profiled genetic alterations including somatic mutations, pathogenic germline variants and CNV along with several genomic markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), copy number instability (CNI) and somatic signatures. From this Chinese cohort we identified a list of frequently mutated genes, with the top 30 illustrated below. "],["cnv-and-prognosis.html", "Section 3 CNV and prognosis", " Section 3 CNV and prognosis We classified 608 PAAD patients into two groups according to CNV: the first group (CNV-G1 with 321 patients) versus the second group (CNV-G2 with 287 patients). We performed differential CNV analysis identifying 115 genes with higher CNV in CNV-G1 than in CNV-G2, and 255 genes with higher CNV in CNV-G2. These 255 genes with higher CNV in CNV-G2 are mostly of functional relevance to DNA repair, including 11 HRR genes (ATM, ATR, BLM, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD51B/51C/51D). These analyses reveal that CNV-G2 patients seemed to obtain an enhanced function of DNA repair (likely HRR), while CNV-G1 patients possessed more depleted DNA repair genes. For convenience, we renamed CNV-G2 as 'repair-proficient', and CNV-G1 as 'repair-deficient'. As shown in the left panel of the figure below, patients in CNV-G2 (repair-proficient) had a worse prognosis than patients in CNV-G1 (repair-deficient). Given the fact that patients in CNV-G1 (repair-deficient) formed a large group in number, we partitioned these patients into two subgroups: one subgroup with high CNV score, and the other subgroup with low CNV score. Comparing repair-deficient patients with high or low CNV score, we identified 203 genes with differential CNV. Genes with higher CNV (in the patient subgroup with higher CNV score) were largely involved in the RTK related signaling pathways. As shown in the right panel of the figure above, worse prognosis was significantly associated with the subgroup with high CNV score as compared to the subgroup with low CNV score. "],["molecular-subtypes.html", "Section 4 Molecular subtypes", " Section 4 Molecular subtypes Collectively considering the information obtained from unsupervised clustering and CNV-based stratification, we were able to categorize PAAD patients into four molecular subtypes: repair-deficient (the repair-deficient group with low CNV score) proliferation-active (the repair-deficient group with high CNV score) repair-proficient (the repair-proficient group with low CNV score) repair-enhanced (the repair-proficient group with high CNV score; notably lacking the survival information for prognostic analysis) Our identified subtypes were informative in prognosis (as shown in the figure): the best prognosis for repair-deficient patients, and the worse for repair-proficient and proliferation-active patients.
